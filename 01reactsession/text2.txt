REACT is the most popular javascript library to build front end application
REACT IS FAST, and why it is fast 

Before going to create an REACT APP
let us just create an Hello World Program 

create index.html

Using HTML

<div id="root">
        <h1>Hello World-HTML</h1>
</div>

Using JavaScript

 <script>
        const heading=document.createElement('h1')
        heading.innerHTML="Hello World-Javascript"
        const root=document.getElementById('root')
        root.appendChild(heading)
</script>

h1 tag was created and was injected inside the root

Using REACT

This all createElement,getElementById,innerHTML how this all is underxstood by the browser
This are all the superpowers which browser already has it.
That why it can reconginize.

Now, Moving forward browser cannot understand REACT. 
first we will have to make it understand

Let us do via CDN:
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

Now, we have injected REACT in our project
Lets go inside the link
Facebook Developers have written this.

When we are importing CDN Links to our project that means we are injecting react into out project.
This is how get React in our project.

Now type React in console .

Now we can use React in our project.
1-react core
2-react-router-dom

React also works on Mobile phone REACT NATIVE.
1st is the core of it 
2nd is the bridge between the react and the browser, ie,react-router-dom

So that why we have REACT DOM in the browser

When we injecting 2 files in our file , we are getting superpowers which REACT is injecting into us.

And now we as Developers use this superpowers and build the large scale application.

Now , let us build the basic Program, hello world.

hello world program created, now just copy and paste the entire stuff in 
app.js and index.html file.

If we want to design it then,
index.css file.
