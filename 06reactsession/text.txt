Now Let us see about Hash Router.

So we just have to go index.js and instead of BrowserRouter we have to write HashRouter.

In this in URL you all will see "#"

So now we will change back.

Next:
We will now put Trailer , when we click (i) button we should get the trailer of it.

>Add Info Button to the Movie.js
>Onclick of the button URL should change.
>url/movies/1 => url/movies/indexno

To change the URL, we will be using new Hook
useNavigate()
Why do we need useNavigate()

Till now we changed the URL with Link Tag.
The Link component is typically used to create clickable links or navigation elements in your application

The useNavigate() hook is part of the React Router library
provides programmatic navigation within your application=> on a click of button


Functionalities:
navigate("/about")=> about page
navigate(-1)=> back
navigate(1)=>next page

For eg:
navigate(3)=> so it will take to next 3 pages.

Lets use Now,

How we will use.
>Movie.js
    > const navigate=useNavigate()

Create an button and just how navigate works.

<button onClick={()=>{navigate('/colorgame')}}>ℹ</button>

Actual how it works, let see

We need index no , so we will go MovieList.js and pass id={index}
and receive as props in Movie

<button onClick={()=>{navigate(`/movies/${id}`)}}>ℹ</button>

  Now, if we go to browser it will take to 404 Page.

  Let comment out this 404 Page from App.js.

  Okay now we can see the url
  http://localhost:3001/movies/1

This URL, we need to provide it in Route
So how we will do it , lets see 

In React, the :id in a route refers to a dynamic parameter or placeholder that can be used to represent a variable value in the URL path. 

you can use :id or any other variable name preceded by a colon (:) to indicate that a specific segment of the URL can vary and should be captured as a parameter.

Now we will useParams()

The useParams() hook is a function provided by the React Router library that allows you to access the dynamic parameters or placeholders defined in your route

console.log(useParams());
Destructure it.
const { id } = useParams();

After this, we will design this page as well, lets see.

Now,rightclick on youtube video
View Ebedded Code

Copy and paste the code in VS code.
<iframe></iframe>

Also we shall update the data , adding trailer in the data as well.
and update the vallues .
>navigate(-1)
> take backwards to the page.
