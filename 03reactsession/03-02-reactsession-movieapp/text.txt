We have to build .

Let create an first component
>Movie 
    >Lets import this App component
    >Give an className to to it
        >movieContainer
            >moviePoster=>img tag
            >movieName  =>h2 tag
            >ratings    =>h2 tag
            >summary    =>p tag

So Now, lets create an template of the above .
Now, Lets design the same.

<div className='movieContainer'>
      <img src="https://www.themoviedb.org/t/p/original/u0XUBNQWlOvrh0Gd97ARGpIkL0.jpg" alt="" className="moviePoster" />
      {/* needs side by side so wrap it in a div */}
      <div className='movieSpecs'>
          <h2 className="movieName">RRR</h2>
          <h2 className="movieRating">⭐9.2</h2>
      </div>
      <p className="summary">Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Quas placeat fugit at sunt nam non. Minima porro quod temporibus incidunt!</p>
    </div>
