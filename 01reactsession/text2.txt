Today, we are going to start with React and it will be a project based learning.
We will be building Application on the same and accordingly we will be moving ahead.

REACT is the most popular javascript library to build front end application
REACT IS FAST, and why it is fast 
This all we will learn 

Before going to create an REACT APP
let us just create an Hello World Program 

create index.html

Using HTML

<div id="root">
        <h1>Hello World-HTML</h1>
</div>

The first ever program which we learn in any language


Using JavaScript

 <script>
        const heading=document.createElement('h1')
        heading.innerHTML="Hello World-Javascript"
        const root=document.getElementById('root')
        root.appendChild(heading)
</script>

h1 tag was created and was injected inside the root

Using REACT

This all createElement,getElementById,innerHTML how this all is underxstood by the browser
This are all the superpowers which browser already has it.
That why it can reconginize.

Now, Moving forward browser cannot understand REACT. 
first we will have to make it understand

First we will bring REact to our Project.
Let us C how we can do that.

1st way is to get the React via CDN

CDN are Content Delivery Network and these are the website where REACT library has been hosted.
We are just pulling REact into our project.

Let us do via CDN:
just above body let us put these CDN links.

<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

Now, we have injected REACT in our project
Lets go inside the link
Facebook Developers have written this.

Now , Browsers will understand REACT.

When we are importing CDN Links to our project that means we are injecting react into out project.
This is how get React in our project.

Now type React in console .

Now we can use React in our project and it is available for our use.
1-react core
2-react-router-dom

React also works on Mobile phone REACT NATIVE.
1st is the core of it 
2nd is the bridge between the react and the browser, ie,react-router-dom
which is used to modify the DOM
So that why we have REACT DOM in the browser


When we are injecting 2 CDN links in our file , we are injected superpowers which REACT is giving to us.

And now we as Developers use this superpowers and build the large scale application.

This was the very fundamental which i wanted to tell you.

Now we are going to use this superpowers
and Now let us just explore the beauty of REACT.

Now , let us build the basic Program, hello world.


hello world program created,
So now 1st hellow world program is build here.

now just copy and paste the entire stuff in 
app.js and index.html file.

When React was built, it was built with a philosophy that manipulate DOM using JS.
React gives us super powers to do so.

Most Costly operation in the Webpage,when the DOM nodes needs to be manipulated.
The DOM Tree is getting changed so that is the most costliest operation over here.

If we want to design it then,
index.css file.

So we have got the CSS as well in the file.
Okay,

Now if we want to create an nested an elements how do we create it.
<div id='parent'>
        <div id='child'>
                <h1></h1>
        </div>
</div>

Suppose now you have to create a siblingd

<div id='parent'>
        <div id='child'>
                <h1></h1>
                <h2></h2>
        </div>
</div>

convert 3 parameter to an array.
so put as an array of children.

And it throws some error , we will see that later on upcoming classes.

<div id='parent'>
        <div id='child'>
                <h1></h1>
                <h2></h2>
        </div>
        <div id='child2'>
                <h1></h1>
                <h2></h2>
        </div>
</div>

So Now, it looks super complicated right,
if it has more nested structure, it will become more complicated and looks ugly.

Thats why we have in React something known as JSX which exists.
We will see this in the next class.
JSX will make our life easy but what i showed you now  is the core of REACT.
This is how REACT offer us.


Now, if we put App.js , above the 2 script tags, will it work?
It wont work.
throws an error => REact is not defined.
