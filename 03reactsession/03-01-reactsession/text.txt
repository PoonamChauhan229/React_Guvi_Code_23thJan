For 15 minutes take the recap of last session.

Now, we create an new Conponent
Counter Component>Like Counter
We have seen this in Facebook, Youtube etc where we hit the button and like and dislike increases.
We are doing a live case scenario
So it will be an fun
So let do that

>Counter.js

useState

So if we want to change the variable
if you need to maintain a variable that changes itself then you need to maintain a react variable

React variable: it's like a state variable every component in react maintain the state
every time you have to create a local variable 
and to create a local variable we will have to use useState hook
so what is a hook?

HOOKS?

HOOKS are normal functions
We get useState hook from react library
It is used to create the state variable
we get it from the react library

const [state]=useState()

useState()=>This returns an array
[]=>state the first element of this array is the variable name
state is reffered as local state variable
This stateName is userdefined, we can use any name of your choice

If you want to give a default value to be useState variable we will have to do give in this way
const [state]=useState("Random")

This is how we create a react variable 
now if we want to modify a variable we have to use function which useState provides it
Lets call that function as setState

So we have to write 
const [state,setState]=useState()
setState=>The second element is a  set function to update the variable

Now 1 question you would ask 
If we have local variables local variables and why do we need a state variables?

Because react has no idea what happening to your local variable
so react won't rerender any update happening on that variable.
Everytime the variable want to be in sync with the UI so for that we need to use state variable

React keeps track of state variable whenever variable is updated the whole body renders and updates it.


For xample , if i have to say

function dbl(n){
  console.log(n*2)
}

function useState(){
  return [10, dbl]
}

const [state,setState]=useState()
setState(state)

Task:
Build an dislike button
Same 

Now, these 2 buttons are sticking to each so design this as well

Now, 
Something we have to start building
