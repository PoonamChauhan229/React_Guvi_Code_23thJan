Theme Change Using MUI Now,
src=>navbar

Theme Change
pass the mode and setMode to navbar

Now after this , we are able to change the cards in dark and light theme
that we need to fix the issue.

if you go to addmovies see here nothing is visible so we need to fix this as well
o how we will do it.

Why the problem here is coming because, who is been subscribed to the data, only MUI component data.
that is why reacted to the change.
not to the components which we have created.

So let us do something and gets subscribed to the backgground as well

So we use some components from MUI to do so.
One such component we have under surfaces.
Paper.
 <Paper elevation={4}>
 </Paper>

 Now, if you see light dark theme ,its not covering or extending the entire page.

if you increase the elevation , the background color will come lighter.

Paper normal behaviour how much is the content it will cover up that part only that means the height of the content.
We can use style attribute
style={{minHeight:100vh}}

Also there is a slight curver across all the sides

borderRadius:"0px"

So we have completed till here, no let us build on game as well
TicTac toe.


TicTac

component
-TicTacToe > Board component
-Gamebox
    > Will have single boxes here 

How many boxes we need like 3 in one row 3*3=9 boxes 

And after this create Board component for Gamebox
-Board
    >call Gamebox
